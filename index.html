        <p>Hi, my name is Reagan Yang, and I am currently attending the UNC Charlotte Full-Stack Program. Previously, I was a Sales Rep for Napa Auto with robust experiences in proactively initiating, contacting, managing, and developing leads on a local basis with Commercial and Non-Commercial Clients. I'm also intrigued by learning new things, especially within the tech realm. Other things I enjoy are anime, gaming, and so much more as long as they bring me interest!</p>
